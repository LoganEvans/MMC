  Current caching algorithms are based on heuristics or inflexible statistical
  models. In this thesis, I present the mixture model caching (MMC) algorithm.
  This algorithm uses a flexible mixture of statistical models to describe the
  current usage of a computer's memory. MMC uses the expectation-maximization
  (EM) algorithm to estimate all model parameters in the mixture before it
  evicts the page with the smallest expected value. I present two mixture
  models -- one that looks at the recency and frequency of page references, and
  one that additionally looks at whether the last reference to a page was for a
  read or for a write.

  I use traces from real systems to demonstrate that MMC makes reasonable page
  eviction decisions. I use published traces to compare both versions of MMC to
  the least recently used (LRU) algorithm and the adaptive replacement cache
  (ARC) algorithm. MMC outperformed LRU and compared favorably with ARC.
