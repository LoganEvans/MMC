This thesis could not have been completed without the help of several people to
whom I owe many thanks. I wish to thank Dr. Terence Soule for his outstanding
help with both the early phases of outlining this research and with the late
phases of coalescing the results into a coherent thesis.

The other two members of my committee also provided valuable assistance. I thank
Dr. Steve Krone for his help on the mathematical portions of this document. I
thank Dr. Clinton Jeffery for his insights into program monitoring.

I thank Cameron Evans, Dr. Jason Evans, and Anton Rang for our discussions of
data structures. I thank Dr. Rinker for his research advice. I also thank Dr. Brian Dennis for his suggestions on statistical models.

My parents, Dr. Donna Evans and David Evans, proofread rough drafts
of this manuscript.

My wife, Kelsie Evans, provided enormous emotional support and further
proofreading help.

I am grateful to Dr. Alan Cox, who asked, \lq\lq Do we take into account any kind
of expected value?" while discussing a caching algorithm. That question was the
seed from which this thesis germinated.
